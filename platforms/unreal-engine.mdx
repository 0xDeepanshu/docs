# Unreal Engine Integration

Gx402 provides Blueprint-first and C++-first patterns for calling x402 via your Express middleware. Unreal packaging, platform constraints, and input methods differ from Unity — this guide focuses on practical handoff patterns (deep links, companion apps, WalletConnect).

---

## Prerequisites
- Unreal Engine 4.27+ or Unreal Engine 5  
- A way to open external browser or webview from a packaged game (for WalletConnect)  
- Companion app / deep-link support for consoles or tight packaging scenarios  
- A Gx402 Express middleware running the `/create-payment` and `/confirm-payment` endpoints

---

## Typical flow (packaged & Blueprint-friendly)
1. Player triggers purchase in UI (Blueprint event).  
2. CreatePaymentNode calls your backend `/create-payment`.  
3. Backend returns `payload` + `paymentId`.  
4. Game opens WalletConnect session (external browser or system webview).  
5. Wallet signs payload; companion app or deep-link returns signature.  
6. Game calls `/confirm-payment` with signature to finalize.

---

## Blueprint concept
- `OnBuy` -> `CreatePaymentNode` -> `OnSuccess` -> `OpenWalletConnect` -> Wait -> `ConfirmPaymentNode` -> `OnFinal` grant item.

---

## C++ (pseudo)
```cpp
// C++ concept using FHttpModule
void UMyStore::CreatePayment(FString ItemId) {
  // POST /create-payment -> parse payload, paymentId
  // Launch external WalletConnect URL
  // Wait for a REST callback or deep link to deliver signature
  // POST /confirm-payment with signature
}
