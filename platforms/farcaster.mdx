description: "Use Gx402 patterns to add x402 payments into Farcaster miniapps and in-game purchases using Unity or Unreal builds. This page adapts the x402 miniapp approach and extends it for engine-built miniapps and in-game flows."

### Quick summary

Gx402 provides **x402 integration examples and server middleware** so teams can accept in-app payments (miniapps) and in-game purchases from engine builds (Unity/Unreal) running inside Farcaster or as standalone games.

We are **not** shipping a proprietary SDK — instead, you get:
- Engine-native examples  
- A recommended Express middleware pattern  
- Deployment notes for reliable x402 payments (`create → sign → confirm → finalize`)

(Adapted from the x402 miniapp template)

## What this page covers

- What Gx402 provides for miniapps and in-game payments  
- Prerequisites and environment configuration  
- Quick Start (clone + run) for Gx402 templates (middleware + engine build)  
- How the template works: middleware, protected endpoints, frontend/engine wiring  
- Special guidance for Unity and Unreal builds running as Farcaster miniapps or standalone games  
- Testing, deployment, best practices, and troubleshooting

## Why use Gx402 for miniapps & games

- **Seamless in-app payments:** let users pay without leaving the miniapp or game UI  
- **Engine parity:** same deterministic payload and server logic for Unity, Unreal, WebGL, Telegram, and Farcaster  
- **Transparent server patterns:** clear Express middleware examples for create/confirm and webhook handling — so you control secrets and audit trails  
- **In-game UX:** patterns and tips for low-friction payment flows (relayer examples, short payloads, optimistic UI guidance)

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and a package manager (`pnpm`, `npm`, or `yarn`)  
- Farcaster uses it's In-App wallet connection so you don't need any external wallet to connect
- x402 provider account & API keys (from your x402 provider)  
- Unity (2021+) or Unreal (4.27+/5.x) for engine builds intended to run inside Farcaster or as standalone apps  
- Basic knowledge of wallet signing (EIP-191 or EIP-712) and server-side HMAC/secret handling
