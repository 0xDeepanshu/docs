# Farcaster & Mobile Integration

Mobile and Farcaster integrations prioritize smooth handoffs and native wallet UX. Gx402 covers patterns for WalletConnect, deep-links, and companion apps so payments feel native and secure.

---

## Prerequisites
- Mobile wallet support (WalletConnect, in-app SDKs)  
- Farcaster mini app configuration (if applicable)  
- Gx402 Express middleware

---

## Mobile flow patterns
- **In-app Wallet:** Directly sign payload within the app.  
- **WalletConnect:** Open WalletConnect modal or deep-link to wallet app.  
- **Companion app (console/packaged):** Use companion to sign and return signature via deep-link.
