## Key terms

- **Payment Session / paymentId**  
  A temporary record in your server that tracks a requested purchase (amount, item, user). You create this locally and include data x402 expects.

- **Payload**  
  The structured message (payment details + metadata) that the user must sign with their wallet. Your server builds this according to x402 requirements.

- **Signature**  
  A cryptographic signature the user's wallet produces over the `payload`. Your server must verify this signature before calling x402 confirm/finalize endpoints.

- **OrderId**  
  Your internal identifier for bookkeeping. Map payment sessions to orderIds for auditing.

- **Webhook**  
  Asynchronous notification from the x402 provider (or your own service) about payment state changes. Verify webhook authenticity using whatever secrets or signatures x402 provides.

- **Idempotency Key**  
  Token used to avoid duplicate processing on retries. Use for `create` and `confirm` server calls.

- **TxHash**  
  Transaction hash returned if the payment involves an on-chain transaction. Track this for receipts and troubleshooting.

## Common payment lifecycle (example)
1. Client calls your backend `POST /create-payment`. Backend creates `paymentSession` and calls x402 create API (or formats payload for the client).  
2. Backend returns `paymentId` + signing `payload` to the client.  
3. Client requests wallet signature (`signature`) and sends it to your backend `POST /confirm-payment`.  
4. Backend verifies `signature`. If valid, it calls x402 confirm/finalize endpoint (or submits an on-chain tx) and stores the outcome.  
5. x402 or your backend may send a `webhook` to confirm final status. Update order state and notify client.

## Security & best practices
- Keep x402 keys and any secret server-side. Examples show placeholders — replace with your secrets.  
- Always verify wallet signatures server-side.  
- Use idempotency keys to make endpoint retries safe.  
- Log `paymentId`, `orderId`, and `txHash` for traceability.  
- Test thoroughly on the x402 test environment (if available).

<Note>
These documents and examples assume direct x402 usage. If/when we provide an SDK or packaged client, we will add clear migration guides and optional SDK examples. For now, the goal is practical, transparent examples you can adapt quickly.
