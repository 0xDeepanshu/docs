# Errors and status codes


Return clear, machine-readable errors from your backend so clients can react properly. Below is a small canonical set we use in Gx402 templates.

## HTTP status conventions
- `200 OK` — success (with JSON payload).  
- `201 Created` — resource created (optional).  
- `400 Bad Request` — client sent invalid data (missing fields, malformed payload).  
- `401 Unauthorized` — signature or webhook verification failed.  
- `403 Forbidden` — client lacks permission.  
- `404 Not Found` — paymentId/session missing.  
- `409 Conflict` — idempotency conflict or already-finalized.  
- `422 Unprocessable Entity` — semantic validation failed (e.g., expired payload).  
- `429 Too Many Requests` — rate limiting.  
- `500 Internal Server Error` — unexpected server error (log and retry).

## Example error response shape
```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "invalid_signature",
    "message": "Signature does not match expected address",
    "details": { "expectedAddress": "0xabc...", "receivedAddress": "0xdef..." }
  }
}
> Note: We will be adding changes to example error response shape for now we are just using x402 response shape!
