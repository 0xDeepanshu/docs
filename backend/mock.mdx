# Testnet Mode


Testing payments safely is essential. x402 commonly offers a sandbox/test environment — use it. If x402 doesn't provide a sandbox, use local mocks and a staging account.

## Options for testing
- **x402 testnet**: if provided, configure your server to call the testbase API endpoints and testnets (Base, solana-devnet, etc.).  
- **Mock provider**: run a lightweight mock x402 server that returns deterministic responses; helpful for offline UI testing.  
- **In-memory store**: for quick dev, store `paymentSession` in memory instead of DB (not for multi-instance testing).
<Note>
we don't provide any configured testnet or mock provider, so we prefer to use local testnets!
