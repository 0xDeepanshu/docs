# Authentication


There are two distinct authentication concerns:

1. **Gx402 Server ↔ x402 provider** (machine-to-machine)
2. **Client (player wallet) ↔ Middleware** (signature-based proof of ownership)

We keep credentials and secret tokens strictly on the server. Clients never hold provider secrets.

## Server ↔ x402 provider
- Use the API key or OAuth scheme the x402 provider gives you.  
- Store provider credentials in environment variables or a secret manager (DO NOT commit them).  
- Protect server endpoints that call x402 with your own authorization (API tokens, JWTs, or internal network rules).



When making a call:
```js
await fetch(`${X402_API_BASE}/payments`, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${process.env.X402_API_KEY}`, 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify(payload)
});
