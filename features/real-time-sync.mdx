# Real-time Sync

The Gx402 SDK provides powerful real-time synchronization capabilities that work seamlessly across all supported platforms, ensuring consistent game experiences for players regardless of their platform.

## Overview

Real-time sync in Gx402 enables:
- Cross-platform game state synchronization
- Multiplayer game state management
- Persistent data sync across sessions
- Offline-first capabilities with automatic sync

## Getting Started

To enable real-time synchronization, configure the Gx402 SDK during initialization:

```javascript
// Enable real-time sync
Gx402.configure({
  enableRealtimeSync: true,
  // Additional configuration options can be set here
});
```

Once enabled, the SDK will automatically manage real-time data consistency across connected clients and platforms.
