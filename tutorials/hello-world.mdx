# Hello World with Gx402

In this quick tutorial, you'll create your **first application using the Gx402 SDK**.  
We’ll build a simple “game” that demonstrates the core idea behind **x402-powered in-game purchases**.


---

## What You'll Build

A small web page with a single button that lets players **buy a Legendary Sword** using **Gx402 payment functionality**.  
This example focuses on the **core purchase flow**, keeping things as minimal as possible.

---

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have:

* 🧠 Basic knowledge of **JavaScript** and **HTML**
* 💻 **Node.js** and **npm** installed
* 🔑 (Optional) Your **Gx402 API key** from the [Gx402 Dashboard](https://Gx402.com)

---

## Step 1: Set Up Your Project

Let’s start fresh.

```bash
mkdir Gx402-purchase-example
cd Gx402-purchase-example
npm init -y
npm install @Gx402/sdk
