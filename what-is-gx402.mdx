title: What is Gx402?
description: Gx402 is a practical collection of **x402 integration examples** tailored for games and mini-app platforms. It demonstrates how to integrate x402 payment flows (create → sign → confirm → finalize) across Unity, Unreal, WebGL, Telegram, Farcaster, and more — using small server middleware examples you can adapt.

---
**Important:** Gx402 is **not** a packaged SDK or a hosted environment. We show the calls and server patterns you need to use **x402** directly. You bring your x402 credentials and wallet integrations; we show how to wire them together.

**Why this approach**
- Flexibility: you control how x402 calls and keys are handled.  
- Transparency: all example code shows raw x402 interactions (no black-box SDK).  
- Portability: examples translate to any engine or backend stack.

**Who should use this**
- Developers wanting direct control over x402 integrations.  
- Teams that need platform examples + middleware patterns rather than a single SDK.

**Future note**
We may provide an official SDK or packaged client later — until then, Gx402 focuses on clear, practical examples for x402 usage.
